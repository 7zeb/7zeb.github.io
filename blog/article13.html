<p>It's crazy to think the Summer Upload boom has ended, it has lasted from May 22, 2025 to
August 12, 2025. Something even more crazy was the fact that we we're able to upload daily for all of
those days. Here are some of the most important things that happened during the Summer Upload Boom.</p>
<br>
<h2>Website updates</h2>
<p>The 7Zeb website got updated to NewUI 3, which is a HUGE UI overhaul from NewUI 2.</p> 
<br>
<h2>Views</h2>
<p>The total amount of views that the channel got during the Summer Upload Boom is 31,262. Which is a great amount, but far less then I expected sadly
The channel did gain 307 Watch Hours, and the channel gained 58 Subscribers.</p>
<br>
<p>Well that's all I've got for this post, so see you in the next one.</p>
