  <h1>History of 7Zeb Booms</h1>

<section id="main">
<p>So, 7Zeb Booms, you might be asking what this a "boom" on the channel is, well it's when constant uploads occur on my channel.</p>
<p>So, let's get into every boom that the 7Zeb has. Starting off in November 2024, with the Minor Upload Boom, which is now called the 1st Fall Upload Boom</p>
<p>Just 1 month later, the Major Upload Boom, which is now known as the 1st Winter Upload Boom, this was HUGE because my channel saw a lot of growth and I got a new laptop.</p>
<br>
<h2>2025</h2> 
<p>On January 6, 2025, the Major Upload Boom (1st Winter Upload Boom) ended, then on March 7, 2025 I started the 1st Spring Upload Boom, which ended on March 16, 2025</p>  
<h3>Future Booms</h3>  
<p>On May 22, 2025, I'm planning on starting the 1st Summer Upload Boom, which will have me uploading from May 22 - August 12, 2025. A lot of videos.</p>
