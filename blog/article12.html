  <h1>April: Month in Review</h1>
  <p>Written on: May 1, 2025</p>

<section id="main">
<p>The month of April, for the 7Zeb channel was MASSIVE, and here's why.</p>
<h3>Views</h3>
<p>Let's do a comparision. In March the channel got 11,839 views, now let's go to April. In April the channel got a MASSIVE 28,696 views, when I look at this number I'm shocked, why? Because that's almost the amount of views I got in 2024 alone.</p>
<p>Something I do want to say is that currently, the 2025 total view count sit's at 52,420 (which beats 2024's total)</p>  
<br>
<h3>The Website</h3>
<p>On April 2, 2025 I annouced the migration from Neocities to Github Pages, and in that time, we migrated the entire site, AND added NewUI, which is INSANE.</p>
<br>
<h3>What I hope in May</h3>
<p>May 2025 is going to be packed, in fact I've made a timeline of events that I think could happen.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>May 2, 2025:</b> The Behind the Scenes Livestream is happening on this day.</li>
  <li><b>May 4, 2025:</b> Skype's Final Call video releasing</li>
  <li><b>May 9, 2025:</b> Installing Mac OS 15 on a 2015 Macbook Pro (hopefully)</li>
  <li><b>May 22, 2025:</b> The Summer Upload Boom starts, marking the begining of daily uploads for 3 WHOLE MONTHS</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>All of this is going to be insane, so let's make May 2025 a good month!</p>
