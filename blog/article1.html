   <p>The iPhone 16, Apple's newest iPhone has some great features, and I think (as an Andriod user) that now there is no excuse not to buy an iPhone, why? Because a couple of new features, here's a list.</p>
   <ol>
   <li>RCS Support has been added</li>
   <li>Camera Button (I wish my Samsung had this)</li>
   <li>Action Button on basic model</li>
   <li>Apple now allows emulators (not specific to the iPhone 16, but introduced this year)</li>
   <li>You can run Windows on your iPhone now!</li>
   </ol>
   <br>
  <p>These are just a few of the things that make the iPhone a great choice if you want a new phone.</p>
