        <p>Today I am happy to annouce that the 7Zeb Website has been migrated to NewUI 4, it was a long process for me to migrate
        the pages (since I had to rewrite almost every HTML code to match the new CSS), Don't worry though, your old content that
        you have been enjoying on this website is still here, still running just fine. Anyways your probably wondering what was added
        in NewUI 4, there are some things you have already seen but some things I'm going to not use right now. In the meantime enjoy
        this list I've made to show you everything new in NewUI 4!</p>

              <section class="glass" id="whats-new">
                <ul>
                  <li>A new glass aero look</li>
                  <li>A new class="glass" thing in sections (this is in the code so you won't see it)</li>
                  <li>A new light/dark mode</li>
                  <li>A new navbar that looks so much better</li>
                  <li>A new footer (it needs some work but we will get it working how I want it soon)</li>
                  <li>Infobox on the right side, It's cool!</li>
                  <li>Cards (so you can see News in Tech This Month after I bring that feature back)</li>
                  <li>Carosuel (for the same thing as cards but I'll show my latest videos instead.)</li>
                  <li>Open-Source (yes NewUI 4 is open-source now, so anyone can use it!)</li>
