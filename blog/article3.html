   <h1>7Zeb - The Upload Schedule</h1>
   <p>During the Major Upload Boom, I had uploaded every day for the event, but now that it is over, I can finally stop stressing about making a new video every day, this is because of school, the only reason I did the Major Upload Boom in the first place was because there was no school during winter break, but now that school has started again, it will be much harder to make videos every day, so I am now going back to the uploading at least once a week schedule, however sometimes I might upload up to 3 times or even more. Fun Fact: The Major Upload Boom actually started one day early on December 19, 2024 because I reuploaded a video that was taken down due to copyright issues, so that is the schedule change for uploads.</p>
   <br>
   <p>One more thing I want to mention is livestreams, on January 5th, and 6th I went live on YouTube, which was a very good idea because many of you seem o enjoy the livestreams, following this succses, I will now annouce that I will try to livestream every single week on YouTube, so I will upload once a week, and I will livestream once a week.</p>
