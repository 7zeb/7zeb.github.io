       <p>So on December 19, 2024, I got a new laptop and a day later, I unboxed it on a YouTube video.</p>
       <br>
       <p>But now it's been 4 months, and here is my review.</p>
       <p>Let's start things off with the speed, at first the laptop was very fast, but after 2 months of use, it struggles to even have 20 tabs open in Brave.</p
       <p>The next thing is RAM, the PC originally only came with 16GB of RAM, but in January 2025 I upgraded the ram to 32GB, as virtual machines need more RAM, I also needed more RAM because I do video editing so that helped.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Gaming</h2>
       <p>Now, I don't play that many games anymore, but I have to say this, if your looking for a gaming laptop, the Dell Inspiron 3535 is NOT the laptop for you, with it's base 16GB of RAM, and integrated graphics, it won't be able to run high-demanding games, however I have tested a few games.</p>
       <p>In Minecraft it get's around 100-200 FPS on the lowest settings, If you change to highest settings, it get's about 30 FPS.</p>
       <p>In Fortnite, it get's around 100 FPS on lowest settings, in highest settings it's not that playable with only about 20 FPS.</p>
       <p>Recording games is also a nightmare, it takes way too much storage to record 12 minutes of Minecraft (about 1.2 GB already), and with the 512GB NVME SSD, space feels limited, I would highly reccomend upgrading to a better SSD.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
       <p>Now let's get into something I use this laptop a lot more for, Virtual Machines, one thing I hate is that there is not an easy way to turn on AMD-V, which is useful if I want to run virtual machines inside of virtual machines.</p>
       <p>It's not all bad though, due to this laptop having an 8-Core CPU, I'm able to run virtual machines with 4 cores (useful for running Windows 11 VM's).</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Video Editing</h2>
       <p>With video editing, the machine does alright, not the best at it, but alright, I'm able to edit smaller videos easily, but larger videos (for example the Septabooting video) take a while to edit, and trying to add captions will completly crash the system.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Dell Bloatware</h2>
       <p>Something I hate about this laptop is the amount of Dell Bloatware that becomes preinstalled, the Dell bloatware will not let you use Wifi 5, or 5Ghz, in fact, until April 2025 (when I reset the laptop), my Wifi was terrible, I was getting 0.38 Mbps (according to speedtest.net), now that I reset the laptop, I'm getting about 150-200 Mbps (according to speedtest.net)</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
       <p>To be honest, this laptop was ok, not too bad, but also not that good, the one thing I will say is that if you can get it for a discount like I did (I got it for $450 at Costco during the winter sales), it's worth it, if you try to buy it right now, it will cost you $699.99, which is not worth it at all.</p>
       <p>If your using it for office work, the Dell Inspiron 3535 is the right laptop for you, if your using it just for web browsing and email, it might be too overkill.</p>
       <p>If your using it for gaming or any other heavy work, it might struggle a bit, but it should be fine.</p>
       <p>as of April 2025, after resetting the laptop, I've had no new issues.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Very Important things you should do</h2>
       <p>Upgrade RAM to 32GB if doing more heavy workloads</p>
       <p>Format the laptop, so you can get better Wifi, and get rid of Dell Bloatware.</p>
