ok no other licenses, i have a better idea.

You can fork the site, but you must remove style.css or any other css files as they are in NewUI, in order to use NewUI, you must request authoriziation from 7Zeb.

Why am I making you do that?
Because NewUI is important, and you CAN NOT use it without permission, if you do, I will kindly ask that you take the site down.
