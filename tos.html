    <h2>What you can copy</h2>  
    <p>The joys of open-source projects, here is what you can copy when you make a fork.</p> 
    <ul>

    </ul> 
    <br>
    <h2>About the CSS</h2>
    <p>You CAN NOT copy any CSS files from this site, if you make a fork of this repository, you MUST remove any CSS files,
    however there are exceptions to this, and they are listed below.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the CSS is from LegacyUI (which was from August 2024 - April 2, 2025)</li>
      <li>If the version of NewUI is an old version (for example: if NewUI 3 is being used on the current site, you can you can
      use NewUI 2 for your project.</li>
      <li>If I (7Zeb) have given you permission to use NewUI in your project.</li>
      <li>If the CSS file contains a comment stating you are allowed to copy it (example: pcbuild25.css)</li>
      <li>If you are improving NewUI (a pull request must be made within a week for this exception to apply)</li>
      <li>If you are not publishing this site online, and are only hosting it locally or having a local copy of it (you still CAN NOT
      have it on a Github Repository)</li>  
    </ol>  
    <p>Please follow these rules on the CSS and you should be fine.</p>
