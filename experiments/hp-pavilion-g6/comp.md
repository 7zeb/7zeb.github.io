# XP Summary Notes
## Summary Notes

-   🎯 **Goal:** Benchmark and document Windows XP SP3’s performance and quirks on post-2010 hardware, preserving its behavior under minimalist conditions in 2025.
-   🧃 **Challenges:**
    -   Setup crashes from `framebuf.sys` (GPU) and `ndis.sys` (Wi-Fi)
    -   Freeze during "Saving Settings"
    -   DVD drive caused hangs during install if media was inserted
    -   No drivers installed due to missing .NET Framework 2.0/3.5
-   🚫 **Driver Status:** Multiple core drivers failed or missing, Device Manager showed numerous unknown devices
-   🔇 **Audio Quirk:** Built-in laptop speakers physically damaged—not a driver issue
-   📦 **Install Highlights:** DVD and USB ports detected, Control Panel and Explorer responsive without optimization
-   💡 **Creative Commentary:**
    -   🗨️ _XP:_ “I installed slow—but booted smooth.”
