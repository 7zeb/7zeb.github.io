    <p>You might have noticed on the Homepage that the News this Month was not showing up because it got discontiuned, and then you probably clikced this link to learn more. Well then Here's why, it's because this site doesn't get updated as often as it used to, so the news could be outdated, in order to make that not happen, I've discontinued the service. Thank You for understanding</p>
