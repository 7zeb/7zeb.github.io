        <p>Soooooo things did not go as planned, introducing PROBLEMS, yeah I only got 2 out of the 4 videos out since my school blocked Clipchamp (the video editor
        I used on my Chromebook) and the only reason I would have multiple videos out every week was because I could edit using Clipchamp, sadly they have blocked
        that now, and I have no idea what to do, I am working on RVE (Rutwik Video Editor) but it is still in early development and doesn't really work that well
        don't worry though, I'm still going to have videos out this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday since I will try to edit at home, if things don't go as planned
        I will probably make another update on the website, anyways in good news the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga has finished Phase 2 of editing (at least the edition
        with all the extras has finished rendering, it is scheduled for October 14, 2025 (if you check my channel) you will be able to see it, and I AM GOING TO
        be HYPING THIS VIDEO UP since it took me an ENTIRE YEAR to make, it was also really really fun recording it.</p>
        <p>Oh my gosh, I have too much to say right now so I have to make a whole new paragraph element, anyways I am also starting the Windows 8 Upgrade Saga, which
        is going to be like the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga except I go from Windows 8 Build 7700 to Windows 8.1 RTM, I'm hoping to get this video out by Windows 8's 13th
        Birthday on October 26, 2026, and I don't know if I will be able to do it, but I'll try! I'll also set up a new page on this website so you can follow along
        with it and I'll post frequent updates about progress and more.</p>

        <h3>September 18, 2025 7:37 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Well hello everyone, I have some news, there's going to be a video coming today, yes today even though it's Thursday and I never upload on Thursday, anyways 
        the thing that is happening is that there is no school on Friday, so I've decided to upload for all 4 days. I already have 2 of the videos ready, but I have to
        edit the other 2, 3 of the videos are going to be Exploring Videos and 1 of them will be an unboxing video.</p>
