        <h3>April 13, 2025 7:30 PM CDT</h3>
        <p>Ok, ok so today was a terrible day, I wasted my time, but now at 7:30 PM, I present to you, one of the hardest challanges I might have to do (ok that's clearly a lie because I have STAAR tests in like 2 days), but this is still a big challange, what is it you might ask? well, I'm adding Project NewUI to a bunch of pages, and also I've realized that I have a bunch of useless pages, for these I'll reuse them or delete them, so yeah. Also I know everyone just wants me to go back to the goold old days where I was just talking about my videos, and Windows, so I'll add a bit of that too, for videos, I'm STILL working on the Unboxing a Headset video, because I can't edit when I get distracted with stupid ideas like adding NewUI, and I also have a TON and I mean a TON of videos that are unedited, looks like I better hurry up and edit instead of coding on Github all day. For the Windows things, I have finished the Windows Vista Upgrade Saga (now I just have to edit) and I also recorded a Windows Vista Starter video which I want to edit too, wow a lot of stuff in this update.</p>
