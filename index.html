        <h3>December 18, 2025 9:04 AM CT</h3>
        <p>2 Updates to the Updates page in a day! Yeah, this is crazy, anyways with the 2nd Winter Upload Boom, Exploring Series #111 is probably going
        to drop today, and then Exploring Series #112 will drop tomorrow. I am also working on a larger video project, which is aka Upgrading from Windows
        XP-10, yeah were doing another upgrade saga... kinda, anyways we're on Windows XP where I left off so yeah hopefully we will get to Vista or
        even 7 today.</p>

        <p>And now, moving on to the next thing, which is of course the Windows 8 Upgrade Saga. We actually got to Build 7800, however we're going to have
        to restart (Attempt 4 time) because 7800 has no USB Drivers, so my plan here is to start over again basically, we're going to install the custom
        Windows 7 ISO (which yes I modified it so we have USB Drivers now) and then I'm going to make a custom Windows 8 Build 7800 ISO with the USB Drivers
        injected (just like I did with Windows 7) so that we can actually get it installed, this will be really good for us because after 7800, I'm probably
        going to move on to the official Milestone 1 Build (which is 7850 if you didn't know). So yeah, it's been a busy week (final exams were also this week
        so it was really chaotic to be honest)</p>
