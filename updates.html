        <h1>Here are the updates from 7Zeb, listed from newest to oldest.</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>October 24, 2025 8:12 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Ok sooooo today I am going to be working on my AWS video today, so yeahhhh that's cool. Anyways hopefully I'll also
        be able to get some Exploring Videos done.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>October 22, 2025 7:54 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>See, I told you I would try to make updates often on here (I was bored), anyways I'm going to work on a AWS Video.
        Recording starts this Friday but I already have the script and thumbnail done, things are looking good for this video
        so far.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>October 21, 2025 10:02 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Well well well, we barely have any videos, luckily I am implementing a 2/1 plan where I have to work on videos for 2 days
        during the weekend and 1 free day, this hopefully will fix the video delays and more. Also AWS was down for 21 HOURS, yeah
        21 Hours, this was wild.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>October 2, 2025 7:16 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone, it's now October. And we have some intresting updates going on for today, currently there are NO videos
        ready for tomorrow (which is Friday), this is a problem because I have commited to trying to upload at least once a week
        and maybe even twice a week. However, due to my school blocking the video editor I use, videos can't be edited on time, I
        have a lot of footage and a lot of video ideas, but I just can't edit any of them, if anything changes I'll be sure to make
        an update on this page letting y'all know.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>September 26, 2025 7:22 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>It's friday (dang this week went by fast for me), anyways the Exploring Series Episode 103 drops today, and we might get an OS Concept tomorrow if I can
        get the video edited in time (I already have it made and recorded), so let's hope we can get it done!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>September 24, 2025 10:35 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Annnnd a new video WILL come out on Friday, because this screenshot confirms it</p>
        <img width="620" height="363" src="https://github.com/7zeb/7zeb-site-assets/blob/main/updates/update1.png?raw=true">
        <br>
        <h3>September 23, 2025 7:42 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Soooooo things did not go as planned, introducing PROBLEMS, yeah I only got 2 out of the 4 videos out since my school blocked Clipchamp (the video editor
        I used on my Chromebook) and the only reason I would have multiple videos out every week was because I could edit using Clipchamp, sadly they have blocked
        that now, and I have no idea what to do, I am working on RVE (Rutwik Video Editor) but it is still in early development and doesn't really work that well
        don't worry though, I'm still going to have videos out this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday since I will try to edit at home, if things don't go as planned
        I will probably make another update on the website, anyways in good news the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga has finished Phase 2 of editing (at least the edition
        with all the extras has finished rendering, it is scheduled for October 14, 2025 (if you check my channel) you will be able to see it, and I AM GOING TO
        be HYPING THIS VIDEO UP since it took me an ENTIRE YEAR to make, it was also really really fun recording it.</p>
        <p>Oh my gosh, I have too much to say right now so I have to make a whole new paragraph element, anyways I am also starting the Windows 8 Upgrade Saga, which
        is going to be like the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga except I go from Windows 8 Build 7700 to Windows 8.1 RTM, I'm hoping to get this video out by Windows 8's 13th
        Birthday on October 26, 2026, and I don't know if I will be able to do it, but I'll try! I'll also set up a new page on this website so you can follow along
        with it and I'll post frequent updates about progress and more.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>September 18, 2025 7:37 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Well hello everyone, I have some news, there's going to be a video coming today, yes today even though it's Thursday and I never upload on Thursday, anyways 
        the thing that is happening is that there is no school on Friday, so I've decided to upload for all 4 days. I already have 2 of the videos ready, but I have to
        edit the other 2, 3 of the videos are going to be Exploring Videos and 1 of them will be an unboxing video.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>September 12, 2025 1:54 PM CDT</h3>
        <p>So it's finally Friday, it's been a very very busy week, and it's FINALLY OVER (I can't stress how long this week was), anyways we have some news, today I can continue working on getting Windows 7 on the Dell Inspiron 5566 (today: testing USB drivers), also some new videos, we all know Windows 8 Build 7797 is dropping today, and I actually don't know what videos are going to work on. I'm probably going to make a exploring build, oh and quick thought right as I was writting this, the Windows ME Retrospective is releasing on September 14, 2025, it will celerbrate Windows ME turning 25 years old! Hopefully I can get it edited though.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>August 28, 2025 7:31 AM CDT</h3>
        <p>Alright, this week will be a busy week for 7Zeb viewers, I'm dropping a video on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and GET THIS EVEN MONDAY!!!
        That's right, the 7Zeb Labor Day Special is happening, in fact I'm doing a dedicated blog post about all the events happening in this
        week, so make sure you go check that out in the blogs section.</p>
        <br>
   <h3>August 22, 2025 10:45 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>So I have some news, there probably won't be a new video for today, or tomorrow, but maybe Sunday this is because of a LOT of things
   for example the drama going on in Mocodonia (my Minecraft Server) and also school started last week so of course I don't have a lot of time
   to record new content. However I will start recording the Windows 98 Build 1602 video tomorrow, so yeah that's great.</p>     
   <br>     
   <h3>August 15, 2025 8:25 AM CDT (Central Daylight Time)</h3>
   <p>Alright so we're back and I'm working on only 1 new video, which is an unboxing video (which you'll probably like), it's
   probably going to release today at either 4:30 PM or 5:00 PM.</p>     
   <br>     
   <h3>July 8, 2025 3:47 PM IST (India Standerd Time)</h3>
   <p>Ok the site is getting huge updates now, NewUI 3 is released, and MOST pages have the new navbar and dark mode/light mode toggle, so go
   check it out, it's actually a good update.</p>     
   <br>     
   <h3>May 21, 2025 11:11 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>It starts tomorrow, but here is what I'm editing right now.</p>
   <ul>
       <li>I Multibooted EVERY Version of Windows Vista</li>
       <li>Exploring Windows Longhorn Build 4029 (main)</li>
       <li>Pre-Recorded EP: 7 - Exploring Windows 2000 Build 1575 Part 2 - Where Everything goes Well?</li>
   </ul>     
   <br> 
   <h3>May 19, 2025 10:33 PM CDT</h3> 
   <p>Ok, so the Summer Upload Boom starts in 3 days, and also for the 3 people wondering why there was no video yestrday, there was a couple of reasons.</p>
   <ul>
       <li>I didn't record (because I forgot)</li>
       <li>I was trying to install Ubuntu on my main PC</li>
   </ul>     
   <br>
   <h3>May 12, 2025 2:21 PM CDT</h3>
   <p>Alright, so what's going to happen over the coming days (as there is only 10 days left until the Summer Upload Boom), well the changes will include this updates page get updated more often, and on May 22 new branding will go into effect, which also does include new CSS styles for this website.
   Another change that will happen is that I will now be in different timezones (from May 26 - August 5)</p>     
   <br>     
   <h3>April 30, 2025 11:55 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Ok, so it's the last day of April and there are some important things coming up, first of all there is now only 22 more days until the Summer Upload Boom, which is INSANE, some other important events includes the behind the scene livestream on May 2, 2025 which is about the Windows Upgrade Saga that i'm doing, also I am finally going to start editing the Multibooting video for real this time, I am also going to update the games pages to NewUI.</p>     
   <br>
   <h3>April 21, 2025 2:13 PM CDT</h3>
   <p>Well, the Easter Upload Boom ended, make sure you don't miss the recap on my channel premiring at 5:30 PM CDT (UTC -5:00 because of DST)</p>     
   <br>
   <h3>April 17, 2025 11:33 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Today is the livestream about Ubuntu 25.04, I have the ISO downloaded already, and also Betavault Beta has the link too, the livestream will probably start at 4:00 PM CDT (9:00 PM UTC), so that's going to be cool.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 13, 2025 7:30 PM CDT</h3>
   <p>Ok, ok so today was a terrible day, I wasted my time, but now at 7:30 PM, I present to you, one of the hardest challanges I might have to do (ok that's clearly a lie because I have STAAR tests in like 2 days), but this is still a big challange, what is it you might ask? well, I'm adding Project NewUI to a bunch of pages, and also I've realized that I have a bunch of useless pages, for these I'll reuse them or delete them, so yeah. Also I know everyone just wants me to go back to the goold old days where I was just talking about my videos, and Windows, so I'll add a bit of that too, for videos, I'm STILL working on the Unboxing a Headset video, because I can't edit when I get distracted with stupid ideas like adding NewUI, and I also have a TON and I mean a TON of videos that are unedited, looks like I better hurry up and edit instead of coding on Github all day. For the Windows things, I have finished the Windows Vista Upgrade Saga (now I just have to edit) and I also recorded a Windows Vista Starter video which I want to edit too, wow a lot of stuff in this update.</p>
   <h3>April 10, 2025 11:17 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>So now Betavault has some Ubuntu versions to download (not all of them), but some of them, I'm going to add more today, I'm also hoping on adding some Xbuntu versions today, for the videos side of things I have a couple of things, first of all, I'm going to be going live on April 17, 2025 (hopefully) to check out Ubuntu 25.04, which will be out on that day. The 2nd thing is that I'm currently editing the Unboxing the headset video, and hopefully will start editing the Multibooting Windows Vista video soon.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 9, 2025 11:31 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Ok, so I made a new Updates page that has all the old updates, but the new UI, most of the pages are going to stay the same but just have thew New UI, find more about the New UI on the 7Zeb Wiki, which is in the github repo.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 5, 2025 10:24 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>Well we have a ton of stuff going on, so let me explain all of it, starting off with the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga, yestrday we beat our goal of installing 2 builds a day and installed 3 builds in a day, this is a huge improvment as now we are far ahead, another thing is we got progress done in the Windows Vista Multibooting video, so it's great to see that, today I'm planning on getting 2 builds on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga, and I'm planning to finish recording the Multibooting Windows Vista video.</p>  
   <br>
   <h3>April 3, 2025 8:33 AM CDT</h3>
   <p>The CSS has been migrated to index.html and updates.html, so that's good.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>April 2, 2025 7:31PM CDT (because we're in DST now)</h3>
   <p>Well the updates page is now on Github pages, YES!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 26, 2025 10:20AM CST</h3>
   <p>The next 2 videos on my channel are done, and also WE HAVE NEW BRANDING AGAIN!!! 2 branding changes in a month is insane, also look out for the Minor Upload Boom which will start on March 7!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 21, 2025 1:07PM CST</h3>
   <p>Today's video has been delayed by 30 minutes because I didn't finish editing :), I'm going to start editing at 4PM (hopefully), so hopefully the video will come out today at 4:30PM, if I don't feel like editing today, I'll livestream me trying to install Windows Longhorn Build 4011.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 14, 2025 4:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>For those of you wondering where the Multibooting video went, it has been delayed until today at 5:00PM CST, the reason why is because well this time is trash.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 11, 2025 9:54AM CST</h3>
   <p>So the video finished exporting, the file size is 2.7GB (for some reason in Clipchamp it showed 2.9 GB) anyways now it's being uploaded to YouTube and it's currently 1% done uploading (this will take a while won't it), I'll keep y'all updated.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 10, 2025 1:22PM CST</h3>
   <p>Ok, so the video is done and it's exporting and it's currently at 5% so it's taking a while, hopefully it can finish exporting quickly.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 10, 2025 12:18PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well well well, I am 97% done editing the multibooting video, I'm currently adding the background music for the video, also the thumbnail is almost done and you'll see it on the Premire page for the video. The video will come out on the 13th hopefully, so let's hope that my video editor doesn't break, and that I can add all the background music, and export the video today. I also want to get the premire set up today but I can't unless the video is done.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 9, 2025 1:14PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well, we have the first teaser post on the updates page of this website, so I'm going to put an image of how the editing for the multibooting video is going. So I hope you enjoy this, looking forward to this epic video coming out soonðŸ”¥</p>
  <a href='https://postimg.cc/MfxFHVzz' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/kGt3jvZR/Screenshot-2025-02-09-1-12-08-PM.png' border='0' alt='Screenshot-2025-02-09-1-12-08-PM'/></a>
   <br>
   <h3>February 9, 2025 9:35AM CST</h3>
   <p>We have some very big news, I decided to restore the website back to normal because I'm most likely (97% sure) returning on February 13 - 15, 2025, my next video will be the multibooting video and I will post some more updates about the video soon. Until then, you can see my website. My channel name will be changed back to 7Zeb after YouTube let's me (because it says I have to wait 12 days before I can change my channel name) so goodbye for now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 8, 2025 11:14AM CST</h3>
   <p>Big News about the Minor Upload Boom that's supposed to take place from March 7 - 16. I am currently trying to decide if I should cancel the Minor Upload Boom, or if I should keep it. Right now, I don't know what videos would even be in there. Also some news regarding this (which I am now calling the 7Zeb Break) is that the multibooting video will still be the first one done. I'm sorry that I can't make community posts or respond to comments right now because YouTube Studio is kind of broken, so I can't do any of that. New Updates should be out in a couple of hours or tomorrow</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 8, 2025 8:49AM CST</h3>
   <p>Welcome back, we have more updates, and some good news (that i'm pretty sure you'll like). I finally can tell you why I was taking a break from YouTube, and I also have news about when I'm coming back (it's earlier than I thought). Ok, let's start with the first thing which is that my internet is terrible, Downloading a 1GB File from the Internet Archive takes 2 hours (most of that has to do with IA taking forever), another thing was school, exams are going to start soon, so this creates a huge problem. However I'm happy to annouce that the day I'm returning to YouTube will be on February 13-15 (one of those days) so much earlier than I thought. (the reason I thought it was May 22, is because I first wanted to wait until school ended, however that's a bad idea, and I didn't want to come back to YouTube in August because that's way too long, and school would start again so what's the point).</p>
     <br>
     <p>Now you might have a couple of questions, the first one is probably: Why Can't you upload in the summer? and the answer to that is pretty simple, it's because during the summer, everyone is using the internet and things just get slow for some reason (the internet in my room is 2mb/s over ethernet). The 2nd question is why are you coming back so early, and to that I say I'm not trying to lose my advanced features from YouTube, because last year (2024) I quit YouTube from May - July, and I lost advanced features. So that's the update, the countdown timer has been updated, and hopefully the website will be back to normal by Monday (February 10), if I get really lucky, I'll could return today, but there's a 99% I won't come back today, so don't think that I will. Bye</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 7, 2025 6:59PM CST</h3>
   <p>I have now decided to quit YouTube temporarly, I might still be on Discord (i don't know), however the day I will return is either May 22, or March 7. I want you to assume it's May 22. Don't worry, I will still post updates regularly, and I plan on having the 500 Subscriber Speical (which is the Multibooting video) to premire on the day I return. I will also have a countdown timer to until I come back. Thanks for understanding, and thank you all for the amazing support.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 7, 2025 1:31PM CST</h3>
   <p>The website has been temporarly shut down, due to me might be quitting YouTube, you might be asking why, and I am not going to answer that currently, I might change my mind later. However for now, the Exploring Minecraft Snapshot 25w05a video (which will prmeire in 2 hours) will be my last video (if i dont change my mind.)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>February 4, 2025 1:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>The 7Zeb videos website has been updated to show new videos on it.</h3>
   <br>
   <h3>January 28, 2025 12:18PM CST</h3>
   <p>This is the first update thing I made on this website in 2025, I actually kind of forgot about this, but anyways I wanted to talk about there being a issue with the multibooting video (my 500 subscriber special which is where I try to multiboot every version of Windows 7), anyways what went wrong was that I accidently messed up all the partitions and have to remake the entire video, so yeah this will take much longer now, hopefully it should come out before March 2025. Another thing I want to mention is the Windows Vista Retrospective video that I am working on, hopefully I can get this done by January 30, 2025 which is when Windows Vista is 18.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>December 19, 2024 8:46AM CST</h3>
   <p>Well, my newest video got taken down so I'm exporting a new one that will come out today, anyways the Major Upload Boom starts tomorrow and the website is getting ready now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 11, 2024 9:18AM CST</h3>
   <p>Hello, sorry for not making a post on Friday (I forgot), anyways we made some videos, and I have to edit the Server 2003 video, which was going to come out yestrday, but I couldn't get it out by then, anyways we have new branding, a new profile picture made by Made in PowerPoint <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@madeinpowerpoint">Go subscribe to him</a>, a new channel banner and website update will be coming soon so stay tuned for that</p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 8, 2024 1:19PM CST</h3>
   <p>Well today's video is going to be Windows 7 Build 6936, and tomorrows video will probably be an install tutorial on Windows Server 2003, I'm also hoping to get though a bunch of builds on the Dell Inspiron 5566's upgrade saga, so hopefully that will happen, another post will be made today talking about some changes I will be doing to the channel.<p>
   <br>
   <h3>November 4, 2024 5:27PM CST (because it's CST now)</h3>
   <p>Hello, and I know last week saturday and sunday did not go as planned, but I do know one thing, Friday's video will be "Exploring Windows 7 Build 6936", another thing I want to say is that the Dell Inspiron 5566 is currently on Build 9821, and will be upgraded to Build 9833 hopefully by Friday (unless another build before 9833 get's leaked)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 29, 2024 1:31PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, the video for Thursday is already done, and the video for Friday is exporting, the videos for Satuarday and Sunday are planned to be the following: On November 2, 2024 the video is UhhSMP Files EP2, and on November 3, 2024 the video is Windows 10 Build 9796, more videos could come out on those days and the videos could change, but for now that's the plan. Another thing I would like to say for this update is the fact Windows 10 Build 9821 is still not installed on the Dell Inspiron 5566, I'm probably going to install it on Thursday.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 28, 2024 8:36AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, I have installed 1 build on the Dell for the upgrade saga so far (Windows 10 Build 9785), the reason I skipped 9780 is because there is no x86 build leaked currently, the next build I'm going to install will be Windows 10 Build 9821, which will be in the upgrade saga video, and will also have it's own video, also a video on Installing Windows 8.1 on the Dell Inspiron 5566 will be coming out on Thursday (I still have a lot to edit for it), so that's the news for right now.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 25, 2024 8:48AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, today Windows XP is 23 Years Old, and I have a good video planned, let's just hope I can record and edit in the same, day, I also want to start working on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga today but don't know if I can, first I have to install Windows 8.1 (hopefully that can be it's own video)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 24, 2024 12:53PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, tomorrow Windows XP will be 23 Years Old, and of course I have a video planned, also on Saturday a video on Grass7 (which is a cool Windows 7 modification) will be released, so make sure you check that out, I'm also working on the Windows 10 Upgrade Saga (I still have to install Windows 8.1)</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 15, 2024 12:52PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, I just wanted to say that Friday's video is somehow already done and is currently rendering, I will just give you a hint on what it is, it's about Windows Whistler 2257.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>October 15, 2024 8:47AM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello eveyrone, the website's HTML code is back, and the site is back to normal, so yeah hopefully the site does not get hacked again</p>

   <p>Hello, everyone, I have coded a game in p5.js, and it is hosted on this website, <a href="https://7zeb.neocities.org/games/orange-paint">Click Here</a> to try it out, it's very simple, and you'll get bored of it in 10 secconds.</p>

   <p>Hello everyone, WE ARE BACK!!!, That's right, New Video is coming Friday (in fact I already have it done. Saturday's video is going to be worked on starting today or tomorrow, I also have some new updates on OS Concepts, BlueOS is almost done, I'm in the OOBE. So that's it for now, see you on Friday when the new video comes out.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 9, 2024 12:15PM CT</h3>
   <p>So, the reason only a video came out on Friday was because I'm working on a big video project called Windows XP Development History, and Windows Whistler Build 2202 was driving me crazy, I could not install it even though I copied the files from MS-DOS to the hard drive, and I set the date back to February 2000. So I was pretty mad at that, anyways hopefully a video comes out on Friday.</p>

   <p>Hello everyone, on September 3, I found an old video I recorded in March 2024, so I started editing the video, I actually finished editing the video, and it will be out tomorrow (Friday), I'll give a hint to what it is. It has to do with Windows Vista Beta builds.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>September 4, 2024 10:12PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone, I want to let you know that I'm working on a very big video project called "The History of 64 Bit Windows" which will be covering how Windows got support for 64 Bit Systems, and how Intel messed up on Intel Itanium.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 27, 2024 6:01PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, a video called "Exploring Windows 8 Build 7878" was supposed to be completed on Sunday, August 25, 2024. However there was a slight issue, while I was recording the video, my ISO file just randomly disapeared, which of course meant that I had to download it again, so you might be asking "Well why is this even an issue, and why are you even making an update about this?", well if you know, my internet is very slow, and I can't use my main computer until Friday, so that means that I have to redownload the 3.2 GB ISO File, which with my bad internet, and the fact that the Internet Archive (where I downloaded Windows 8 Build 7878) is blocked on my other computer, so now I have to wait until Friday to download the ISO file.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 23, 2024 - 5:35PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, everyone, some slight issues are making the 3 YouTube videos a bit delayed, hopefully they still come out today.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>August 21, 2024 - 7:33 PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello, we are getting closer to Friday, which is the day, that 3 videos go out, yes 3 whole videos will go out, I might also do a video on this website, as I don't think anyone on my YouTube channel knows about this website, unless you found my YouTube channel on Neocities.

   <h3>August 20, 2024 - 5:54 PM CT</h3>
   <p>Hello everyone, I just want to let you know that I have regained accses to my Google Account, 2 new (hopefully 3 new) videos should be out by Friday, if not then there is something wrong with me, my phone, or my computer. I have a couple of reasons why I'm not uploading every few days.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>My Internet has gotten bad all of a sudden, I have solved this by installing a network extender in the room I record, edit, and upload videos in.</li>
   <li>School has started, which means that I have to focus on schoolwork instead of making YouTube videos, like I used to do during summer.</li>
   <li>I'm working on a big video project, so even when I do get free time to work on videos, I'm busy working on that. I'll give you a hint to what it is. It involves Windows 95 in it, as I have said in my Discord Server.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>I hope you understand that all of this will make uploads less frequent, however I'm still comminting to try and do weekly uploads, if there are no videos out that week, you will get a reason why on this webpage. Thanks, and I'll upload the next video on Friday.</p>

   <p>Hello, everyone I have some bad news, I'm locked out of my Google Account, and the only way that I can get it back is to use a code on my phone, however I have lost my phone, so until I find my phone, I guess there will be no videos, don't worry though, I will keep on editing videos so that when I do get my account back. I already have 2 ready</p>
